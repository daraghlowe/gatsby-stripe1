title: Gatsby Script API
---

> Support for the Gatsby Script API was added in `gatsby@4.15.0`.

Gatsby includes a built-in `<Script>` component that aids in loading third-party scripts performantly.

It offers a convenient way to declare different loading strategies and a default loading strategy that gives Gatsby users strong performance out of the box.

## Using Gatsby Script in your site

Here is an example of how you can import and use the `<Script>` component in your site's JSX or TSX source files:

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
// highlight-next-line
import { Script } from "gatsby"

function MyPage() {
  // highlight-next-line
  return <Script src="https://my-example-script" />
}

export default MyPage
```

It can also be used in the following [Gatsby SSR](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) and [Gatsby Browser](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) APIs:

- `wrapPageElement`
- `wrapRootElement`

> Note - If you use one of these APIs, it is recommended that you implement it both in Gatsby SSR _and_ Gatsby Browser. A common pattern is to define a single function that you import and use in both files.

Here's an example using `wrapPageElement` in both Gatsby SSR and Gatsby Browser without duplicating your code:

```jsx:title=gatsby-shared.jsx
import React from "react";
import { Script } from "gatsby";

export const wrapPageElement = ({ element }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {element}
      <Script src="https://my-example-script" />
    </>
  );
};
```

```jsx:title=gatsby-ssr.jsx
export { wrapPageElement } from "./gatsby-shared";
```

```jsx:title=gatsby-browser.jsx
export { wrapPageElement } from "./gatsby-shared";
```

> Note - Other examples on this page will exclude the import statements and function component unless it is necessary.

## Migrating existing scripts

For most scripts, you can migrate to Gatsby Script by importing the `<Script>` component in your file and changing the lowercase `script` tag names to capitalized `Script` tag names:

```diff
import { Script } from "gatsby";

-<script src="https://my-example-script" />
+<Script src="https://my-example-script" />
```

By default, the `<Script>` component will load your script after hydration. For more information on declaring loading strategies, see the [Strategies](#strategies) section.

## Scripts with sources and inline scripts

There are two types of scripts that you can tell the `<Script>` component to load:

- Scripts with sources
- Inline scripts

### Scripts with sources

Scripts with sources provide a `src` property like this:

```jsx
<Script src="https://my-example-script" />
```

The `<Script>` component will use the value of `src` to deduplicate loading, so if you include two scripts on the same page with the same `src`, only one will load.

If for some reason you need to load two scripts with the same sources on the same page, you can provide an optional, unique `id` property to each and the `<Script>` component will attempt to load both:

```jsx
<Script id="first-unique-id" src="https://my-example-script" />
<Script id="second-unique-id" src="https://my-example-script" />
```

### Inline scripts

Inline scripts must include a unique `id` property and can be defined in two ways:

- Via React's special [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml) property
- Via a template literal

Here's a look at both:

```jsx
<Script id="first-unique-id" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: `alert('Hello world')` }} />
<Script id="second-unique-id">{`alert('Hello world')`}</Script>
```

Functionally, both of these ways of defining inline scripts are equivalent.

## Strategies

You can declare a loading strategy by passing a `strategy` property. These are the available loading strategies:

- `post-hydrate` - Loads after the page has hydrated
- `idle` - Loads after the page has become idle
- `off-main-thread` (experimental) - Loads off the main thread in a web worker via [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io)

The best strategy to use depends on the functionality of the script you would like to include.

A general rule of thumb is if your script can afford to be loaded later (as many analytics scripts can be), then start with `off-main-thread` or `idle` and move to earlier loading strategies if necessary.

Here's how you can define these strategies in the `<Script>` component:

```jsx
<Script src="https://my-example-script" strategy="post-hydrate" />
<Script src="https://my-example-script" strategy="idle" />
<Script src="https://my-example-script" strategy="off-main-thread" />
```

Additionally, Gatsby exports a `ScriptStrategy` enum that you can use in TSX files if you prefer:

```tsx
import { Script, ScriptStrategy } from "gatsby"

<Script src="https://my-example-script" strategy={ScriptStrategy.postHydrate} />
<Script src="https://my-example-script" strategy={ScriptStrategy.idle} />
<Script src="https://my-example-script" strategy={ScriptStrategy.offMainThread} />
```

### Off main thread strategy (experimental)

The `off-main-thread` strategy leverages [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io) under the hood, so it requires further configuration. See the [Partytown configuration](https://partytown.builder.io/configuration) documentation for complete details.

Here is an example configuring the `<Script>` component with [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/):

```tsx
import { Script, ScriptStrategy } from "gatsby"

// `process.env.GTM` is your Google Analytics 4 identifier defined in your `.env.production` and `.env.development` files

<Script
  src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.GTM}`}
  strategy={ScriptStrategy.offMainThread}
  forward={[`gtag`]}
/>
<Script id="gtag-config" strategy={ScriptStrategy.offMainThread}>
  {`
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    window.gtag = function gtag() { window.dataLayer.push(arguments); }
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', ${process.env.GTM}, { send_page_view: false })
  `}
</Script>
```

#### Forward collection

Gatsby will collect all `off-main-thread` scripts on a page, and automatically merge any [Partytown forwarded events](https://partytown.builder.io/forwarding-events) defined via the `forward` property into a single configuration for each page:

```jsx
<Script
  src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.GTM}`}
  strategy={ScriptStrategy.offMainThread}
  // highlight-next-line
  forward={[`gtag`]}
/>
```

The `forward` property is the only Partytown-specific property that is handled by the `<Script>` component.

#### Proxy configuration

Many scripts [require a proxy to work in Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/proxying-requests), so Gatsby has built-in proxy functionality to make this easier. To keep the proxy secure, you must define the absolute URLs you want proxied in your Gatsby config.

Here's how you would do that for the Google Analytics example above:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config({
  path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}`,
});

module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Gatsby`,
  },
  // highlight-next-line
  partytownProxiedURLs: [
    `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.GTM}`
  ],
}
```

This works out of the box when running your site via `gatsby develop`, `gatsby serve` and Gatsby Cloud.

Hosting on other providers requires support for Gatsby's [`createRedirect`](/docs/reference/config-files/actions/) action to rewrite requests from `/__third-party-proxy?url=${YOUR_URL}` to `YOUR_URL` with a 200 status code. You may need to check with your hosting provider to see if this is supported.

#### Debugging

You can leverage Partytown's [vanilla config](https://partytown.builder.io/configuration#vanilla-config) to enable debug mode for your off-main-thread scripts:

```jsx:title=gatsby-ssr.js
import React from "react";

export const onRenderBody = ({ setHeadComponents }) => {
  setHeadComponents([
    <script
      key="test"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        __html: `partytown = { debug: true };`,
      }}
    />,
  ]);
};
```

You may need to adjust your dev tools to the verbose log level in order to see the extra logs in your console.

It is recommended that you only make use of the `debug` property in Partytown's vanilla config to avoid unexpected behavior.

#### Limitations

By leveraging [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io), scripts that use the `off-main-thread` strategy must also be aware of the [limitations mentioned in the Partytown documentation](https://partytown.builder.io/trade-offs). While the strategy can be powerful, it may not be the best solution for all scenarios.

In addition:

- `off-main-thread` scripts load only on server-side render (e.g. initial page render, page reload, etc.) and not on client-side render (e.g. navigation via Gatsby Link)
- `off-main-thread` scripts cannot use the `onLoad` and `onError` callbacks

### `onLoad` and `onError` callbacks

Scripts with sources loaded with the `post-hydrate` or `idle` strategies have access to two callbacks:

- `onLoad` - Called once the script has loaded
- `onError` - Called if the script failed to load

> Note - Inline scripts and scripts using the `off-main-thread` strategy **do not** support the `onLoad` and `onError` callbacks.

Here is an example using the callbacks:

```tsx
<Script
  src="https://my-example-script"
  onLoad={() => console.log('success') )}
  onError={() => console.log('sadness') )}
/>
```

Duplicate scripts (scripts with the same `id` or `src` attributes) will execute `onLoad` and `onError` callbacks despite not being injected into the DOM.

Access to the `onLoad` and `onError` callbacks also enables the ability to load scripts dependently. Here's an example showing how to load the second script after the first:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react"
import { Script } from "gatsby"

function MyPage() {
  const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState<boolean>(false)
  return (
    <>
      // highlight-next-line
      <Script src="https://my-example-script" onLoad={() => setLoaded(true)} />
      {loaded && <Script src="https://my-other-example-script" />}
    </>
  )
}

export default Page
```
